## [Abstract Analyzer](https://azj31tvvek.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/)

![A demo GIF was here..](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wingkitlee0/wingkitlee0.github.io/master/images/demo.gif)

When a paper is being submitted to the [arxiv](www.arxiv.org) preprint server, the author needs to manually select which category the paper belong to. This [webapp](https://azj31tvvek.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/) allow user to enter their abstract (i.e., a few lines of the summary of their important paper), then the code will analyze it and suggest a category it belongs (in astronomy). The classification task is done by a small neural network (trained by submitted abstracts).

Check the title for the webapp. 

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/wingkitlee0/arxiv_explore).

*More details are coming*, including how to deploy the webapp (with numpy and tensorflow) onto Amazon Lambda serverless service.

## Demo of webapp (20 news group  dataset)

(It may take a few seconds to load.)

Before fully implementing the above project, I tried to make a working demo. This demo takes two numbers (features) from users, and predict which type of Iris it should belong. While it is a textbook machine learning, I have made an web app.

Features:
- Data (model parameters) are hosted on *Amazon S3*
- Webapp is running on *Amazon Lambda* using *flask*
