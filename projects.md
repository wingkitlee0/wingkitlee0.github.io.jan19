## Projects

Here are a few projects that I have done during spare time.

### [Abstract Analyzer](https://azj31tvvek.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/)

![A demo GIF was here..](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wingkitlee0/wingkitlee0.github.io/master/images/demo.gif)

This is a webapp that analyzes the summary of a paper and classify it into one of the astro-ph categories. I put the details [here](machinelearning.md)


### Alexa Skills ("Apps" on Amazon's Echo devices)

I have written two Alexa skills (astroph, astroph Earth). Basically they allow you to listen to the 5 newest academic paper abstracts submitted to the preprint server (arxiv.org). The RSS feeds from [arxiv.org](arxiv.org) are updated daily. The details of how to create with AWS Lambda / Flask-Ask etc can be found [here](https://wingkitlee0.github.io/alexa astroph). In short, I wrote a short python script (hosted on AWS Lambda) to convert the RSS feed to an Alexa-readable JSON file.

### Contributions to open-source projects

I have also contributed to some open-source projects. I am not the owner of these packages but did make some improvements.

#### [scikits.bvp_solver](https://github.com/wingkitlee0/scikits.bvp_solver)

This is a Python library for solving two-point boundary value problems, based on a well-known Fortran library ([BVP_SOLVER](http://cs.stmarys.ca/~muir/BVP_SOLVER_Webpage.shtml)). Both original Fortran and the Python wrapper were life-savers for me on my PhD thesis.
Contributions:
- Added Python 3 compatibility
- Added support on Windows + ming-w64
- Added support for equations with complex variables

#### [scikit-cuda](https://scikit-cuda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This is a Python wrapper for the [MAGMA](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/magma/) GPU linear algebra library, which allows drop-in replacement of the scipy package. The MAGMA library is needed because the standard linear algebra library from NVIDIA (i.e., CUSOLVER) does not have all the routines included. 
Contributions:
- Added support for non-symmetric eignvalue solver (i.e., geev in standard LAPACK library).

### [Arxiv Reader](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/arxiv-reader/9nblggh5kb5j) (Mobile)

This is an app to browse papers via the RSS feeds from [arxiv.org](arxiv.org). Over a hundred of acquisitions on the Windows Phone platform.
